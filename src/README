beaglebone-iot

Internet Of Things is heading of - the beaglebone is the right choice for a performant 
plattform wth all neccessary tools and enough horse power to give relieable results.

Some design decission I made:
* droped angstrom - yes they have this neat node.js and cloud9 IDE but no python twisted
* node.js is 0.4.9 actual is 0.6.x - to much changes expected in near future
* installed ubuntu oneiric - same experience as from laptop - easier development
* development IDE eclipse + PyDev - code completion and so on ... 
* python twisted
* MQTT for python twisted
* txosc - incorparate touchOSC or similar touch interfaces
* py-openzwave - a bit tricky to compile - needs evluation
* mosquitto-client for dubugging and testing - simple just works
* mosquito on the server side - simple just works

if node is more stable & code base is set it is for shure an interessting alternative to python twisted
